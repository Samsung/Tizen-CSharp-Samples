# VoiceMemo #

The Voice Memo sample application demonstrates how you can create an application using the following APIs:
 - Tizen.Wearable.CircularUI (including Xamarin.Forms)
 - SQLite
 - Tizen FX APIs (Tizen.Applications, Tizen.Content.MediaContent, Tizen.Multimedia, Tizen.System, Tizen.Uix.Stt, Tizen.Security, etc )

Network Connection(e.g. Wi-Fi) is required at runtime.

Note that this app provides similar functions to Tizen Native/Web voicememo sample apps.
It does not cover full features of voice memo application in app store.
It supports only some selected features to show API usage and do API verification.
